## Data Set

__NOTE__: The data files for this project are too large to be hosted on github, and are provided on the Blackboard website. Please go to blackboard and download the data seperately.

Please ensure that the following files:

* cuhk03_new_protocol_config_labeled.mat
* feature_data.json

Are present in the directory CW2/PR_data by copying the file into the directory.

## Jupyter Notebooks

All the distance learning methods discussed in the report are available in the Jupyter Notebooks in this directory. For a simple, one click method of generating all our figures, simply 'Run All Cells' in the notebook.

#### The python in this coursework is running on the jupyter notebook, link to install the jupyter platform: https://jupyter.org/install

* python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
* python3 -m pip install jupyter

#### Details of this project is described in the report, cw2_zl6114_apl115.pdf.
