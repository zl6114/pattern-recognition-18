# Coursework 2

## Tasks

### Zihan

* K Means baseline
* Metric Learning Library
    1. Try a few out

### Aufar

* Mahalanobis Distance
    1. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34643548/how-to-use-mahalanobis-distance-in-sklearn-distancemetrics)
* Neural Net? ( Takes far too long to try )

## Report

### 100 Word Summary

### Formulation Of the Machine Learning Problem you Address

### Perform evaluation experiment of the baseline approach

* KNN
* K Means

### Proposed improved approach, discussing what challenge and how it is specifically addressing

* All the metric learning libraries we try
    1. 3 or so methods
    2. Explain how each method tackles a slightly different problem, explain how it does it
* No real improvements
* Neural Network approach
    1. Siamese networks
    2. Talk about how would have liked to implement this

### Insightful and comparitive evaluation of the proposed approach

* For each method we try, explain why it did fuck all

### Source Code

* Upload to github, see below for refactor

## Source Code Refactor

* Need to refactor all the code so that it can run straight away.
* Setup a virtualenv with all the packages installed on python 3.6 that user can just build
* Rewrite Jupyter Notebooks into standalone.py files
    1. Or we could rewrite Jupyter Notebooks so that they are nice and clean, and just tell them to run the whole file ( Easier I think )
